header: A graphical simulation of stellar bodies written in Java.  
---

A simulation of gravity between stellar bodies. Written in Java for a grade 11 CS project. 

After inputting the initial parameters, a number of small, medium and large masses are added to the simulation. The bodies then interact through simulation of a graviational force using a user defined gravitational constant. The initial velocity and initial mass is randomly generated for each body. 

Bodies with high mass are identified with red, medium with green and low with blue. Within each mass group, relative mass is determined by size (bigger the circle = the greater the mass).

A fixed central body can also be added. The value of the gravitational constant is requested on start. A constant < 1 is suggested.

# Demo

Above shows a fixed central body with around 20 or so smaller bodies orbiting/drifting.

Here is a slightly more hectic scenario with a decent number of red, blue and green masses all drifting freely.

100+ small bodies, 20+ medium, 20+ large
This one was a little bit crazy.
